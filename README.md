# Japanese from First Principles

As of creating this project, I don't speak Japanese. This is a collection of notes and tools that I will build as I learn Japanese.

## Methodology

I was recently inspired by the process of [languagetransfer.org](https://www.languagetransfer.org), and so I am roughly building off their philosophy, while providing ways to practice. Essentially, that looks like this:

1. Focus on explaining how the language functions: how sentences are constructed, how to guess what the correct thing to say is, etc. We will try to introduce one concept of the language at a time.
2. Use flashcards and other activities for practice, and not memorization. We will try to introduce large sets of flashcards that focus on using each concept. The hope is that there are enough of them that you can understand a concept without seeing repeats of flashcards.
3. Once we introduce enough concepts, release you into the wild to consume content.

## How this Project is Organized

I will be splitting up all this learning into "weeks". Not because it took me a week, but because I think that it's a chunk of information that could be studied for a week to learn at a reasonable pace. Each week will focus on a few new concepts, and build upon each of the previous. They will be split into a folder with a README explaining the concept/goals of the week.
