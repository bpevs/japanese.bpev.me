# Japanese from First Principles

As of creating this project, I don't speak Japanese. This is a collection of notes and tools that I will build as I learn Japanese.

## How this Website Works

I will be splitting up all this learning into "weeks". Not because it took me a week, but because I think that it's a chunk of information that could be studied for a week to learn at a reasonable pace. Each week will focus on a few new concepts, and build upon each of the previous. They will be split into a folder with a README explaining the concept/goals of the week. Optionally, you may also find such activities as:

1. A set of SRS flashcards for learning nouns
2. A large set of non-SRS flashcards that are not meant to be used for memorization, but are meant to apply the concept(s) that we have learned this week. They will only apply nouns from that week and prior weeks. There should be "too many flashcards to memorize", and you should just use them until you feel comfortable with the concepts.

These flashcards will probably be available on a website that I will build in conjunction with learning Japanese. There will probably be non-flashcard activities as well, and they will be explained within that week's README.
