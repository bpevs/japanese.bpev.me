# Week 1 - Hiragana (ひらがな)

One of the first things you will hear about Japanese is the 3 different methods of writing characters: Hiragana and Katakana alphabets, and Kanji characters. You will also hear about Romaji, the romanization system for [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Japanese).

### Why focus on ひらがな?

ひらがな is the most common way to describe the phonetics of words in Japanese. Aside forom being ome examples of ひらがな being used in common places is:

- [Furigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana) is the method most commonly used for [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) pronunciation aids. These are generally hiragana characters.
- When typing on your phone, you will typically type the sounds with ひらがな, and then convert it to Katakana or Kanji.

### What about Katakana, Kanji, and Romaji?

**Katakana** - Katakana represents that a word is a borrowed foreign word. So for an English speaker, it's tempting to jump into Katakana first, because you can often understand words that you sound out. I don't have anything particularly against doing that. However, since the sounds are entirely the same, I think it gets confusing to learn ひらがな and katakana at the same time. For this reason, we will intentionally try to avoid katakana until we are comfortable with ひらがな.

**Kanji** - We will slowly be learning kanji as we expand our vocabulary. We won't be ignoring kanji. We just won't be focusing on it.

**Romaji** - In this course, we will little to no romaji, in order to prevent it from becoming a crutch, because for pronunciation, we should primarly rely on ひらがな. For learning ひらがな, we will try to lean on audio as much as we can, instead of Romaji.

# 1. Write and type ひらがな

Here's how it'll work:

- See the page showing a set of characters
- Listen to an audio flashcards for those characters
- Write the character a few times
- Some example words using these characters will be in the answer. So practice writing those.
- Also practice typing after if you have some time. It's easier on phone.

Do this after #1. You should be able to recognize words.
