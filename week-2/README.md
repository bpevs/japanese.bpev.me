# Week 2

> NOTE: I haven't finished building week 1 yet; I need to update for the rest of basic ひらがな, primarily usage of modifier/subscript characters, double vowels. But since this website tends to lag behind my actual learning, and I really would like to get more practice with sentence building, I'm gonna work on these in parallel.

At the end of Week 1, I will have made a flashcard deck of some basic nouns, verbs, and adjectives. For Week 2, these will help us construct basic sentences.

As much as I can during this process, I will focus on building practice tools, and let other sources actually do the teaching. So for this one, let's look at an article on sentence structure (this week's practice will focus on the parts before the "Beyond the Basics" section):

## Exercise 1

We will focus on a few basic structures

- Simple Sentences ("犬です" (is a dog), "来る" (is coming), "かわいいです" (is cute) )
- [subject]が[verb|adjective]
- [topic]は[verb|adjective]
- [object]を[verb|adjective]

We will also add [か](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese-grammar/particle-ka/), to signify simple questions.　"犬です (it is a dog)" -> "犬ですか (is it a dog?)"
