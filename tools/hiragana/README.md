# Exercises

**Exercise 1 - Write and type ひらがな**: Kana will be split into sets; try to do 1-2 each day. Each set will introduce 10 new kana, and then use them in words. Do not try to "complete" the word list, as it is long and will repeat forever.

**Exercise 2 - Noun Flashcards**: Start word recognition!

# Why Practice Writing?

When I first started wrigin kana, I noticed small differences in the characters much better. For instance, before I started writing, I thought that あ and お were mostly the same character, but with an additional "\`". Only after writing did I notice that the body of the character was different as well.
